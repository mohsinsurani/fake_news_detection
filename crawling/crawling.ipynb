      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Paris Jackson and Cara Delevingne were spotted out on the town in New York! The rumored couple even wore matching outfits for their excursion… so what gives? Are they dating?\\n\\nCara Delevingne, 25, and Paris Jackson, 20, have been stirring up romance rumors left and right and their latest outing is only fueling the fire. The pair were spotted hanging out together in New York City just a few hours after they each attended the Longchamp Fifth Avenue store opening on May 3. Paris wore a printed white t-shirt, jeans, and black booties, while the Paper Towns star rocked a strikingly similar ensemble: a white tank top, denim Bermuda shorts and black knee-high boots.\\n\\nWhile the two women have yet to confirm whether or not they’re dating, fans are dying to know their relationship status. Fortunately, we’ve heard that there’s a unique bond between them. “Cara and Paris are crazy about each other,” a source close to the British model tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “They have amazing chemistry and a super strong attraction. Whenever they’re together they have an awesome time.”\\n\\nHowever, their time together is often limited due to scheduling conflicts – as per most celebrity friendships and relationships. “Cara and Paris don’t get to see each other as much as they would like to right now, as Cara’s work schedule is insane, but when they do they really make the most of their time together,” our insider adds. “Cara is totally smitten with Paris, she loves how smart and funny she is, and finds her sexy as hell.”\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time this week that the two models had fans questioning if they were an item. Paris shared a pic of her rumored girlfriend’s profile on Instagram. The image showed Cara blowing smoke from a cigarette out of her mouth and standing outside against a wall. What’s most interesting about the photo, however, is that she also had a giant red lipstick mark on her cheek.

Here are some of their responses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a rally in New York City, Sarah Silverman addressed Trump directly. \"Show us your f--king taxes, you emotional child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/NYjusticeleague/status/853308612567072769\\r\\n\\r\\n13 director Ava Duvernay shared photos of various signs, including one that echoed Silverman\\'s expletive and another with a \"Game of Thrones\" reference.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/ava/status/853305641850486784\\r\\n\\r\\nAndy Richter also tweeted a graphic poster.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/AndyRichter/status/853304283713855488\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain America\" star Chris Evans simply posted \"liar\" and a clip to an interview where Trump said he would release his taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/853332025868025856\\r\\n\\r\\nActor Ike Barinholtz thanked the protesters and called out the fact that the President was making his 17th golf trip this weekend after 12 weeks in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/ikebarinholtz/status/853317302963404800\\r\\n\\r\\nJon Cryer posted a shot of a sign that played on the \"Star Wars\" mania.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/MrJonCryer/status/853331534450794496\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President, an avid social media user, \\xa0has yet to tweet a response to today\\'s Tax March protests.', 'fragment': '!', 'content_type': 'Article', 'title': 'Celebrities Join Tax March in Protest of Donald Trump', 'msapplication-window': 'width=device-width;height=device-height', 'twitter': {'text': {'title': 'Celebrities Join Tax March in Protest of Donald Trump'}, 'image': 'https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taxivader.jpg', 'creator': '@Variety', 'description': 'Those protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'We\\'d venture to say that Cindy Crawford\\'s daughter Kaia Gerber has had it pretty good as a brunette, especially since she inherited that brown hair — and the rest of her features — from her supermodel mom.\\n\\nBut the 14-year-old seems to be testing the waters of being a blonde, posting a picture on Instagram yesterday of herself with piecey platinum locks.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a permanent new \\'do, though — she assured her followers it was \\'just a lil wig\\', adding a smiley face emoticon.\\n\\nTrying a new \\'do! Kaia Gerber showed off a short blonde wig on Instagram on Thursday\\n\\nReal hair: The 14-year-old has long, brown locks that tumble down to her waist — quite like her mom\\'s\\n\\nTwins! Kaia often draws comparisons to her mother, and had the same features — and same long legs — as the supermodel\\n\\nWith her slicked locks and bold, dark brows, the young model looks a whole lot more like singer Rita Ora than her lookalike mom in the one-off picture.\\n\\nAt shoulder length, the wig is much shorter than her real hair, too, which usually tumbles down to her waist.\\n\\nKaia shared the picture just hours after letting her brown locks flow for a lunch with her mom and One Direction star Harry Styles .\\n\\nStopping by Cafe Habana in Malibu for a catch-up, the 22-year-old singer could be seen enjoying a meal and with the supermodel, 50, her husband Rande Gerber, and Kaia.\\n\\nHarry — who has previously visited the Crawford/Gerber clan at their home — looked pleased to be spending some of his downtime catching up with old friends in California.\\n\\nArriving at the family\\'s table in the upmarket Cuban and Mexican eatery, the One Direction star was greeted with a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek from world-famous beauty.\\n\\nEarlier that day: Kaia had enjoyed lunch with her parents and One Directioner Harry Styles on Thursday\\n\\nBlossoming friends: Kaia was particularly thrilled when Harry arrived at the house in 2014, and even had a snap of herself and the 1D star taken\\n\\nThe long-haired lothario teamed a tropical-inspired shirt with a pair of skinny fit denim jeans and suede camel boots.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kaia — who graces the cover of April\\'s Vogue Paris with her mother — opted for an all-black ensemble, teaming a sleeveless top with skin-tight jeans and a pair of leather Chelsea boots.\\n\\nCindy wore a cream blouse, which she kept casual with form-fitting denim jeans. With her famous chestnut locks falling down past her shoulders, the model highlighted her naturally striking and extremely youthful visage.\\n\\nFormer male model and businessman Rande dressed in a relaxed outfit like Harry, donning a navy short-sleeved shirt, jeans and boots.\\n\\nThe Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy\\'s home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out.\\n\\nAnd following the home visit, the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving.\\n\\nHobnobbing with boybanders: Cindy has also taken Kaia to One Direction concerts\\n\\nPizza buddies: The Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy\\'s home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out\\n\\nDaredevil dudes: And following the home visit the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving\\n\\nDuring their time at Cindy\\'s home, Harry gave Cindy some of his valuable expertise that he picked up when he worked in a bakery before finding success as a pop star.\\n\\nShe told V Magazine in 2014: \\'He stopped by to say hi when my kids and I were making pizzas. My kids were doing their own little pizzas and they couldn\\'t slide them off the pan.\\n\\n\\'Harry goes, \\'\\'Well, did you put down enough flour so they wouldn\\'t stick?\"\\'\\n\\n\\'My husband says, \\'\\'How in the world do you know that?\\'\\' and my little girl chimes in, \\'\\'Oh, he used to work for a bakery, dad. Everyone knows that.\"\\'\\n\\nPlaying the role of embarrassing mom well, she added that her then-12-year-old daughter had a crush on Harry.', 'source': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'publish_date': '1458358075.0', 'url': 'www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3499192/Do-blondes-REALLY-fun-Cindy-Crawford-s-model-daughter-Kaia-Gerber-puts-theory-test-peroxide-wig-dining-Harry-Styles.html', 'canonical_link': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3499192/Do-blondes-REALLY-fun-Cindy-Crawford-s-model-daughter-Kaia-Gerber-puts-theory-test-peroxide-wig-dining-Harry-Styles.html', 'authors': ['Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com', 'Jj Nattrass For Mailonline'], 'top_img': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/18/18/3257238600000578-0-image-a-38_1458325076379.jpg', 'keywords': [], 'meta_data': {'robots': 'noodp,noydir,all,noarchive', 'fb': {'app_id': 146202712090395, 'pages': '1622758588037001,164305410295882'}, 'divclasspage': 'articlePage', 'doc-class': 'Living Document', 'y_key': '1a7e912afbfcab2f', 'mol': {'headline': \"Do blondes REALLY have more fun?

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'We\\'d venture to say that Cindy Crawford\\'s daughter Kaia Gerber has had it pretty good as a brunette, especially since she inherited that brown hair — and the rest of her features — from her supermodel mom.\\n\\nBut the 14-year-old seems to be testing the waters of being a blonde, posting a picture on Instagram yesterday of herself with piecey platinum locks.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a permanent new \\'do, though — she assured her followers it was \\'just a lil wig\\', adding a smiley face emoticon.\\n\\nTrying a new \\'do! Kaia Gerber showed off a short blonde wig on Instagram on Thursday\\n\\nReal hair: The 14-year-old has long, brown locks that tumble down to her waist — quite like her mom\\'s\\n\\nTwins! Kaia often draws comparisons to her mother, and had the same features — and same long legs — as the supermodel\\n\\nWith her slicked locks and bold, dark brows, the young model looks a whole lot more like singer Rita Ora than her lookalike mom in the one-off picture.\\n\\nAt shoulder length, the wig is much shorter than her real hair, too, which usually tumbles down to her waist.\\n\\nKaia shared the picture just hours after letting her brown locks flow for a lunch with her mom and One Direction star Harry Styles .\\n\\nStopping by Cafe Habana in Malibu for a catch-up, the 22-year-old singer could be seen enjoying a meal and with the supermodel, 50, her husband Rande Gerber, and Kaia.\\n\\nHarry — who has previously visited the Crawford/Gerber clan at their home — looked pleased to be spending some of his downtime catching up with old friends in California.\\n\\nArriving at the family\\'s table in the upmarket Cuban and Mexican eatery, the One Direction star was greeted with a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek from world-famous beauty.\\n\\nEarlier that day: Kaia had enjoyed lunch with her parents and One Directioner Harry Styles on Thursday\\n\\nBlossoming friends: Kaia was particularly thrilled when Harry arrived at the house in 2014, and even had a snap of herself and the 1D star taken\\n\\nThe long-haired lothario teamed a tropical-inspired shirt with a pair of skinny fit denim jeans and suede camel boots.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kaia — who graces the cover of April\\'s Vogue Paris with her mother — opted for an all-black ensemble, teaming a sleeveless top with skin-tight jeans and a pair of leather Chelsea boots.\\n\\nCindy wore a cream blouse, which she kept casual with form-fitting denim jeans. With her famous chestnut locks falling down past her shoulders, the model highlighted her naturally striking and extremely youthful visage.\\n\\nFormer male model and businessman Rande dressed in a relaxed outfit like Harry, donning a navy short-sleeved shirt, jeans and boots.\\n\\nThe Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy\\'s home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out.\\n\\nAnd following the home visit, the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving.\\n\\nHobnobbing with boybanders: Cindy has also taken Kaia to One Direction concerts\\n\\nPizza buddies: The Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy\\'s home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out\\n\\nDaredevil dudes: And following the home visit the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving\\n\\nDuring their time at Cindy\\'s home, Harry gave Cindy some of his valuable expertise that he picked up when he worked in a bakery before finding success as a pop star.\\n\\nShe told V Magazine in 2014: \\'He stopped by to say hi when my kids and I were making pizzas. My kids were doing their own little pizzas and they couldn\\'t slide them off the pan.\\n\\n\\'Harry goes, \\'\\'Well, did you put down enough flour so they wouldn\\'t stick?\"\\'\\n\\n\\'My husband says, \\'\\'How in the world do you know that?\\'\\' and my little girl chimes in, \\'\\'Oh, he used to work for a bakery, dad.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'We\\'d venture to say that Cindy Crawford\\'s daughter Kaia Gerber has had it pretty good as a brunette, especially since she inherited that brown hair — and the rest of her features — from her supermodel mom.\\n\\nBut the 14-year-old seems to be testing the waters of being a blonde, posting a picture on Instagram yesterday of herself with piecey platinum locks.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a permanent new \\'do, though — she assured her followers it was \\'just a lil wig\\', adding a smiley face emoticon.\\n\\nTrying a new \\'do! Kaia Gerber showed off a short blonde wig on Instagram on Thursday\\n\\nReal hair: The 14-year-old has long, brown locks that tumble down to her waist — quite like her mom\\'s\\n\\nTwins! Kaia often draws comparisons to her mother, and had the same features — and same long legs — as the supermodel\\n\\nWith her slicked locks and bold, dark brows, the young model looks a whole lot more like singer Rita Ora than her lookalike mom in the one-off picture.\\n\\nAt shoulder length, the wig is much shorter than her real hair, too, which usually tumbles down to her waist.\\n\\nKaia shared the picture just hours after letting her brown locks flow for a lunch with her mom and One Direction star Harry Styles .\\n\\nStopping by Cafe Habana in Malibu for a catch-up, the 22-year-old singer could be seen enjoying a meal and with the supermodel, 50, her husband Rande Gerber, and Kaia.\\n\\nHarry — who has previously visited the Crawford/Gerber clan at their home — looked pleased to be spending some of his downtime catching up with old friends in California.\\n\\nArriving at the family\\'s table in the upmarket Cuban and Mexican eatery, the One Direction star was greeted with a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek from world-famous beauty.\\n\\nEarlier that day: Kaia had enjoyed lunch with her parents and One Directioner Harry Styles on Thursday\\n\\nBlossoming friends: Kaia was particularly thrilled when Harry arrived at the house in 2014, and even had a snap of herself and the 1D star taken\\n\\nThe long-haired lothario teamed a tropical-inspired shirt with a pair of skinny fit denim jeans and suede camel boots.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kaia — who graces the cover of April\\'s Vogue Paris with her mother — opted for an all-black ensemble, teaming a sleeveless top with skin-tight jeans and a pair of leather Chelsea boots.\\n\\nCindy wore a cream blouse, which she kept casual with form-fitting denim jeans. With her famous chestnut locks falling down past her shoulders, the model highlighted her naturally striking and extremely youthful visage.\\n\\nFormer male model and businessman Rande dressed in a relaxed outfit like Harry, donning a navy short-sleeved shirt, jeans and boots.\\n\\nThe Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy\\'s home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out.\\n\\nAnd following the home visit, the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving.\\n\\nHobnobbing with boybanders: Cindy has also taken Kaia to One Direction concerts\\n\\nPizza buddies: The Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy\\'s home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out\\n\\nDaredevil dudes: And following the home visit the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving\\n\\nDuring their time at Cindy\\'s home, Harry gave Cindy some of his valuable expertise that he picked up when he worked in a bakery before finding success as a pop star.\\n\\nShe told V Magazine in 2014: \\'He stopped by to say hi when my kids and I were making pizzas. My kids were doing their own little pizzas and they couldn\\'t slide them off the pan.\\n\\n\\'Harry goes, \\'\\'Well, did you put down enough flour so they wouldn\\'t stick?\"\\'\\n\\n\\'My husband says, \\'\\'How in the world do you know that?\\'\\' and my little girl chimes in, \\'\\'Oh, he used to work for a bakery, dad. Everyone knows that.\"\\'\\n\\nPlaying the role of embarrassing mom well, she added that her then-12-year-old daughter had a crush on Harry.', 'source': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'publish_date': '1458358075.0', 'url': 'www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3499192/Do-blondes-REALLY-fun-Cindy-Crawford-s-model-daughter-Kaia-Gerber-puts-theory-test-peroxide-wig-dining-Harry-Styles.html', 'canonical_link': 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3499192/Do-blondes-REALLY-fun-Cindy-Crawford-s-model-daughter-Kaia-Gerber-puts-theory-test-peroxide-wig-dining-Harry-Styles.html', 'authors': ['Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com', 'Jj Nattrass For Mailonline'], 'top_img': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/18/18/3257238600000578-0-image-a-38_1458325076379.jpg', 'keywords': [], 'meta_data': {'robots': 'noodp,noydir,all,noarchive', 'fb': {'app_id': 146202712090395, 'pages': '1622758588037001,164305410295882'}, 'divclasspage': 'articlePage', 'doc-class': 'Living Document', 'y_key': '1a7e912afbfcab2f', 'mol': {'headline': \"Do blondes REALLY have more fun?

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Many stars saw great success in 2016, but the year wasn’t without its major celebrity scandals. Here are some of the worst celebrity scandals of the year:\\n\\n1. Chumlee’s home raided\\n\\n“Pawn Stars” favorite Austin Lee Russell, better known as Chumlee, was arrested in March after police serving a search warrant in a sexual assault investigation found methamphetamine, marijuana and a gun at his southwest Las Vegas home. The 33-year-old was booked on 19 drug-possession charges and one weapon charge. In May, the reality star took a plea deal and agreed to counseling and three years\\' probation.\\n\\n2. Taylor Swift’s image questioned\\n\\nHollywood good girl Taylor Swift came under intense scrutiny in 2016 after her messy breakup with Calvin Harris and her reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.\\n\\nFirst, Harris slammed Swift for comments her PR team made about a song they’d worked on together. Referencing Swift’s long rumored feud with Katy Perry he wrote on Twitter, “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry...”\\n\\nThen, Swift slammed Kanye West at the Grammys for his lyrics to “Famous,” in which he rapped about her “I made that bitch famous.” At the Grammys, Swift cautioned her fans about “people… who try to undercut your success or take credit for… your fame.\" West insisted he’d had the pop star’s permission to include her in his song, and in July, Kim Kardashian was ready to prove it. She released a recording of Swift speaking with West, approving of her name being used on the track.\\n\\nThe incidents left Swift fans wondering if the starlet was secretly a celebrity mean girl.\\n\\nSince then, however, she has avoided controversy and done charity work that likely has her back in the good graces of the Twitterverse.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Ryan Lochte’s lie\\n\\nRyan Lochte had a lot going for him as he headed to Rio for the Olympics over the summer, but the spotlight-hungry swimmer was branded a liar after he claimed he’d been robbed at gunpoint while out in Brazil, and then recanted the story once inconsistencies became apparent. Lochte lost his sponsorships over the incident, and the Olympic Committee banned him from swimming through June 2017. He also lost $100,000 in bonuses.\\n\\nStill, the swimmer landed a short-lived slot on “Dancing with the Stars” and got engaged to his Playboy model girlfriend, so all in all he didn’t have the worst 2016 ever.\\n\\n4. Accusations against Johnny Depp\\n\\nIn May, Johnny Depp made headlines for all the wrong reasons when his ex Amber Heard accused him of abusing her. In the weeks that followed, a video leaked of a violent clash between Heard and Depp and fans quickly turned on the actor. His camp denied the abuse allegations and several of his famous exes came forward to defend his character. In August, Depp and Heard quietly settled their divorce. He has since landed a role in J.K. Rowling’s upcoming sequel to “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”\\n\\n5. Brad Pitt abuse allegations\\n\\nBrangelina fans were shocked when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced they were going their separate ways in 2016. The pair announced they were calling it quits in September, and things turned even more dramatic when rumors swirled that Pitt was being accused of abusing their oldest son Maddox. In November, the FBI wrapped their investigation into an alleged argument between Pitt and Maddox that took place on a plane, and the agency announced no charges would be filed against Pitt.\\n\\n6. Kimye turmoil\\n\\nBoth Kim Kardashian and Kanye West faced serious struggles in 2016. Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in October in Paris and thieves made off with millions of dollars in jewelry. The Instagram addict removed herself from the public eye after the traumatic experience. She stopped sharing things on social media and avoided public appearances, opting to stay home with her family.\\n\\nThen, at the end of November, her husband Kanye West’s trademark erratic behavior took a serious turn when he was hospitalized for a reported psychotic breakdown. The rapper had been ranting more than ever during his concerts – something he is known for – and abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour. He was then suddenly hospitalized and Kim rushed to be by his side. 2016 wasn’t the best year for the Hollywood hot couple to say the least.\\n\\n7. Gigi mocks Melania\\n\\nIn November, model Gigi Hadid faced backlash after she mocked Melania Trump during her speech at the American Music Awards. \"I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children Sasha and Malia,\" Hadid said through pouted lips and a fake accent, mocking Melania\\'s RNC speech that lifted material from a speech given by Michelle Obama.\\n\\nThe 21-year-old sort of apologized and said that her impression was \"done in good humor.\"', 'source': 'http://www.foxnews.com', 'publish_date': '1481871600.0', 'url':

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Many stars saw great success in 2016, but the year wasn’t without its major celebrity scandals. Here are some of the worst celebrity scandals of the year:\\n\\n1. Chumlee’s home raided\\n\\n“Pawn Stars” favorite Austin Lee Russell, better known as Chumlee, was arrested in March after police serving a search warrant in a sexual assault investigation found methamphetamine, marijuana and a gun at his southwest Las Vegas home. The 33-year-old was booked on 19 drug-possession charges and one weapon charge. In May, the reality star took a plea deal and agreed to counseling and three years\\' probation.\\n\\n2. Taylor Swift’s image questioned\\n\\nHollywood good girl Taylor Swift came under intense scrutiny in 2016 after her messy breakup with Calvin Harris and her reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.\\n\\nFirst, Harris slammed Swift for comments her PR team made about a song they’d worked on together. Referencing Swift’s long rumored feud with Katy Perry he wrote on Twitter, “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry...”\\n\\nThen, Swift slammed Kanye West at the Grammys for his lyrics to “Famous,” in which he rapped about her “I made that bitch famous.” At the Grammys, Swift cautioned her fans about “people… who try to undercut your success or take credit for… your fame.\" West insisted he’d had the pop star’s permission to include her in his song, and in July, Kim Kardashian was ready to prove it. She released a recording of Swift speaking with West, approving of her name being used on the track.\\n\\nThe incidents left Swift fans wondering if the starlet was secretly a celebrity mean girl.\\n\\nSince then, however, she has avoided controversy and done charity work that likely has her back in the good graces of the Twitterverse.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Ryan Lochte’s lie\\n\\nRyan Lochte had a lot going for him as he headed to Rio for the Olympics over the summer, but the spotlight-hungry swimmer was branded a liar after he claimed he’d been robbed at gunpoint while out in Brazil, and then recanted the story once inconsistencies became apparent. Lochte lost his sponsorships over the incident, and the Olympic Committee banned him from swimming through June 2017. He also lost $100,000 in bonuses.\\n\\nStill, the swimmer landed a short-lived slot on “Dancing with the Stars” and got engaged to his Playboy model girlfriend, so all in all he didn’t have the worst 2016 ever.\\n\\n4. Accusations against Johnny Depp\\n\\nIn May, Johnny Depp made headlines for all the wrong reasons when his ex Amber Heard accused him of abusing her. In the weeks that followed, a video leaked of a violent clash between Heard and Depp and fans quickly turned on the actor. His camp denied the abuse allegations and several of his famous exes came forward to defend his character. In August, Depp and Heard quietly settled their divorce. He has since landed a role in J.K. Rowling’s upcoming sequel to “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”\\n\\n5. Brad Pitt abuse allegations\\n\\nBrangelina fans were shocked when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced they were going their separate ways in 2016. The pair announced they were calling it quits in September, and things turned even more dramatic when rumors swirled that Pitt was being accused of abusing their oldest son Maddox. In November, the FBI wrapped their investigation into an alleged argument between Pitt and Maddox that took place on a plane, and the agency announced no charges would be filed against Pitt.\\n\\n6. Kimye turmoil\\n\\nBoth Kim Kardashian and Kanye West faced serious struggles in 2016. Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in October in Paris and thieves made off with millions of dollars in jewelry. The Instagram addict removed herself from the public eye after the traumatic experience. She stopped sharing things on social media and avoided public appearances, opting to stay home with her family.\\n\\nThen, at the end of November, her husband Kanye West’s trademark erratic behavior took a serious turn when he was hospitalized for a reported psychotic breakdown. The rapper had been ranting more than ever during his concerts – something he is known for – and abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour. He was then suddenly hospitalized and Kim rushed to be by his side. 2016 wasn’t the best year for the Hollywood hot couple to say the least.\\n\\n7. Gigi mocks Melania\\n\\nIn November, model Gigi Hadid faced backlash after she mocked Melania Trump during her speech at the American Music Awards. \"I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children Sasha and Malia,\" Hadid said through pouted lips and a fake accent, mocking Melania\\'s RNC speech that lifted material from a speech given by Michelle Obama.\\n\\nThe 21-year-old sort of apologized and said that her impression was \"done in good humor.\"', 'source': 'http://www.foxnews.com', 'publish_date': '1481871600.0', 'url':

It wasn’t appointment television for her to see Tom and others she has dated.”\\n\\nWhen Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston broke up months ago, rumors swirled in regard to possible arguments and tension over their highly-publicized relationship.

While Swift has yet to make her future plans for new music official, she has been regularly releasing new music since her first album in 2006 and was reportedly inspired to create new songs after her split from Hiddleston.\\n\\n“[Taylor Swift] is handling things well and she is working on music and writing lyrics down all the time especially since she has been involved in so many recent high profile news stories with [Tom Hiddleston] or [Kanye West] and even the Super Bowl speculation,” a source told Hollywood Life. “She has a lot of material to work off.”\\n\\nA new album is “still a work in progress because when she puts something out she wants to fully support it with a tour and television appearances,” the source continued. “She is enjoying a little break so there is still some time for all of that.”\\n\\nSince splitting from Hiddleston last year, Taylor Swift has been keeping a low profile as she focuses on her career and friendships with her popular girl squad, which includes Lily Aldridge and Gigi Hadid.\\n\\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]', 'source': 'http://www.inquisitr.com', 'publish_date': '1484094824.0', 'url': 'www.inquisitr.com/3871816/taylor-swift-reportedly-reacts-to-tom-hiddlestons-golden-globes-win/', 'canonical_link': 'https://www.inquisitr.com/3871816/taylor-swift-reportedly-reacts-to-tom-hiddlestons-golden-globes-win/', 'authors': ['Lindsay Cronin'], 'top_img': 'https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift-tom-hiddleston-2.jpg', 'keywords': [], 'meta_data': {'fb': {'app_id': 164157850314499, 'pages': 71179904752}, 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/06950f/dist/images/logos/favicon-32x32.png', 'viewport': 'width=980', 'news_keywords': 'Taylor Swift, Tom Hiddleston, Rumors, Celebrities', 'y_key': 'f282393706a5fd85', 'article': {'published_time': '2017-01-10T17:33:44+00:00'}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'image': {'width': 940, 'identifier': 'https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift-tom-hiddleston-2.jpg', 'height': 545}, 'type': 'article', 'description': 'Taylor Swift has reportedly reacted to news of her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston’s recent win at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Consider this a call to arms. Kate McKinnon needs our help.\\n\\nYou see, the “Saturday Night Live” MVP is the only full-time cast member in the show’s 43-year history to win two Emmys. From Bieber impressions to alien abductions, she is its deft quarterback, its kooky crown jewel, its melodic moral compass ― every bit as essential to the lineup as Kristen Wiig or Amy Poehler or Eddie Murphy or John Belushi.\\n\\nWhy, then, on God’s sin-ridden earth, can no one write her a good movie role?\\n\\nSeeing as McKinnon is the best part of anything she’s in, it can be easy to forget she’s never had a good role. That’s because she’s, well, Kate McKinnon, able to elevate characters that otherwise coast on one-note hijinks. Often, they’re not so much characters as they are walking punch lines: the whimsical engineer in “Ghostbusters,” the buttoned-up HR coordinator in “Office Christmas Party,” the bossy redneck in “Masterminds,” the Australian madcap in “Rough Night” and now the adventurous unemployed actress in “The Spy Who Dumped Me.”\\n\\nAll of these roles play out the same way. McKinnon is a sidekick to more established movie stars, introduced as the eccentric friend, wife or colleague with an odd collection of life experiences that act as a stand-in for character development. As Holtz in “Ghostbusters,” she’s a “gluten-full” skier who somehow put a physicist in a coma. As Pippa in “Rough Night,” she’s an animal whisperer who once perished and came back to life during a drug trip in the desert. As the buffoonish Jandice in “Masterminds,” her husband died from a snake bite; at his funeral, she fell in love with his “distant cousin.”\\n\\nAnd as Morgan in “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” her biography includes getting deported from Belize, doing cocaine with her basketball coach, being the target of Mandy Patinkin’s advances, discussing penis preferences with her mom and inviting a magician to live in her grandmother’s condo.\\n\\nLionsgate Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis in \"The Spy Who Dumped Me.\"\\n\\nInstead of giving her characters depth, screenwriters give them anecdotes. McKinnon delivers lines like these matter-of-factly, as if anyone who doesn’t relate is a freak ― a convincing way to tap into the irony of her full-bodied ebullience. She plays walking scrapbooks overflowing with uproarious one-liners and wacky reaction shots, having become a go-to for nimble physical humor that evokes Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey. But those performers’ manic verve had sell-by dates: Ball’s attempts to re-create the joys of “I Love Lucy” never quite worked, Paramount Pictures eventually declined to renew Lewis’ contract, and Carrey grew tired of being a tool for box-office capital.\\n\\nOr perhaps it’s more apt to compare McKinnon to her “SNL” predecessors. Take, for example, Will Ferrell, inarguably one of the biggest movie stars the sketch series has produced. Ferrell and McKinnon share a penchant for visceral oddballs, but a few things set them apart. First, Ferrell gets to headline movies, whereas McKinnon is always second fiddle. (The entire plot of “The Spy Who Dumped Me” revolves around Mila Kunis.) Secondly, Ferrell’s lead roles, however silly they may be, have proper arcs with family histories and detailed psychologies (see: “Elf,” “Talladega Nights,” “Step Brothers”). And finally, Ferrell ― like Kristen Wiig, Adam Sandler and Bill Murray ― has evidenced that he is more than a one-trick pony by taking astute roles in thoughtful character studies (see: “Stranger Than Fiction,” “Everything Must Go”).\\n\\nMcKinnon, on the other hand, has so far been pigeonholed as little more than the resident nut job, tasked with making googly eyes or thinning her voice to steal scenes in unremarkable chaos comedies.\\n\\nSony Chris Hemsworth, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig in \"Ghostbusters.\"\\n\\nSooner or later, that schtick runs thin for even the sharpest performers. Even Eddie Murphy, once a supreme movie star, descended from “Beverly Hills Cop” to “Daddy Day Care.” And McKinnon, like Murphy before her, is far too good for that. She deserves a part that doesn’t feel like an “SNL” bit pushed beyond its limits, where the musicality of her voice and the dementedness of her dexterity are more than devices for cheap chuckles.\\n\\n“The Spy Who Dumped Me,” directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel (“Life Partners”), is the ultimate example of this. In “Spy,” an action comedy with a third act that has far too much action and hardly enough comedy, Morgan is the daring BFF who can drop everything to delve into international assassin mayhem that really has nothing to do with her.\\n\\nMorgan doesn’t have much to offer the plot beyond aiding Kunis’ Audrey, so she enlists the help of onetime flame Edward Snowden to take down the crime syndicate that Audrey is wrapped up with. Like most of McKinnon’s big-screen characters, Morgan has an impressive sexual prowess, but it’s only evidenced with an implicit wink. She can’t have normal relationships, no way; she needs to have the world’s most famous dissident on speed dial.\\n\\nThere’s a key moment in “Spy” that presents a unified theory of the Kate McKinnon Cinematic Universe. Speaking, rather rudely, for everyone who comes in contact with a feature-length McKinnon character, Audrey’s boyfriend (Justin Theroux) tells her she is “a little much.”\\n\\nSony Zoë Kravitz, Jillian Bell, Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in \"Rough Night.\"\\n\\nIn that one line, the movie reveals that it knows it’s resting on McKinnon’s antics ― and that “Ghostbusters,” “Office Christmas Party,” “Masterminds” and “Rough Night” knew too. They wanted her to be too much. They insisted on it. Is she good for anything else? These projects wouldn’t know.\\n\\nIn a rare emotional exchange toward the end of “Spy,” Morgan concedes that her career isn’t thriving and she fears everyone thinks she’s “a little much.” Because it’s so far removed from anything we’ve seen of Morgan in the previous 100 minutes, the sentiment barely lands. It reads like a note from a Screenwriting 101 guidebook ― ground this character in something real, won’t you? But what it really does is emphasize everything that’s preventing McKinnon from achieving greatness.', 'source': 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com', 'publish_date': '1533322817.0', 'url': 'www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-mckinnon-the-spy-who-dumped-me_us_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48', 'canonical_link': 'https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-mckinnon-the-spy-who-dumped-me_us_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48', 'authors': ['Matthew Jacobs', 'Entertainment Reporter'], 'top_img': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1910_1000', 'keywords': [], 'meta_data': {'taboola.category': 'entertainment', 'fb': {'app_id': 46744042133, 'pages': 70242384902}, 'article': {'section': 'Entertainment', 'tag': 'Movies,comedy,SNL,kate mckinnon,The Spy Who Dumped Me', 'published_time': '2018-08-03 08:00:17 -0400', 'modified_time': '2018-08-03 10:51:14 -0400'}, 'oath': {'guce': {'product-eu': 'false', 'locale': 'en-US', 'consent-host': 'guce.huffingtonpost.com', 'inline-consent': 'true'}}, 'google-site-verification': '97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8', 'al': {'ios': {'app_store_id': 306621789, 'url': 'huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48', 'app_name': 'HuffPost'}}, 'keywords': 'Movies,comedy,SNL,kate mckinnon,The Spy Who Dumped Me', 'viewport': 'width=1000', 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'url': 'https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-mckinnon-the-spy-who-dumped-me_us_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48', 'type': 'article', 'description': '\"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" like several films before it, reduces McKinnon\\'s comedic genius to cheap laughs.', 'site_name': 'HuffPost', 'image': {'width': 1910, 'url': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1910_1000', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'identifier': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1910_1000', 'height': 1000}, 'title': \"For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?\"}, 'description': '\"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" like several films before it, reduces McKinnon\\'s comedic genius to cheap laughs.', 'twitter': {'image': {'width': 1910, 'identifier': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1910_1000', 'height': 1000}, 'creator': 'tarantallegra', 'description': '\"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" like several films before it, reduces McKinnon\\'s comedic genius to cheap laughs.', 'card': 'summary_large_image', 'title': \"For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?\", 'site': '@HuffPostEnt'}}, 'images': ['https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b3812f91a0000cd04ce3068.jpeg?cache=huege11hhb&ops=210_120', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b6334441900002b00c6b71c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/oath-footer-white-4f6d0a4bbc98c395c8c4e2c7536851b43338ff822be8e91cc77cfbcf7e5efdd1.svg', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8af452000007d06eb523c.jpeg?cache=2cqqu2iwvs&ops=210_120', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5942c941160000210011660e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale', 'https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1910_1000', 'https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a963dd1e00003c00c6060e.jpeg?cache=d498hsivi3&ops=210_120', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b6333b31900002a00c6b71b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559aa8911e00006aeadcb4b1.jpg?ops=100_100', 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=crop_27_211_1377_1247,scalefit_720_noupscale'], 'title': \"For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?\", 'movies': [], 'summary': ''}\n",

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Consider this a call to arms. Kate McKinnon needs our help.\\n\\nYou see, the “Saturday Night Live” MVP is the only full-time cast member in the show’s 43-year history to win two Emmys. From Bieber impressions to alien abductions, she is its deft quarterback, its kooky crown jewel, its melodic moral compass ― every bit as essential to the lineup as Kristen Wiig or Amy Poehler or Eddie Murphy or John Belushi.\\n\\nWhy, then, on God’s sin-ridden earth, can no one write her a good movie role?\\n\\nSeeing as McKinnon is the best part of anything she’s in, it can be easy to forget she’s never had a good role. That’s because she’s, well, Kate McKinnon, able to elevate characters that otherwise coast on one-note hijinks. Often, they’re not so much characters as they are walking punch lines: the whimsical engineer in “Ghostbusters,” the buttoned-up HR coordinator in “Office Christmas Party,” the bossy redneck in “Masterminds,” the Australian madcap in “Rough Night” and now the adventurous unemployed actress in “The Spy Who Dumped Me.”\\n\\nAll of these roles play out the same way. McKinnon is a sidekick to more established movie stars, introduced as the eccentric friend, wife or colleague with an odd collection of life experiences that act as a stand-in for character development. As Holtz in “Ghostbusters,” she’s a “gluten-full” skier who somehow put a physicist in a coma. As Pippa in “Rough Night,” she’s an animal whisperer who once perished and came back to life during a drug trip in the desert. As the buffoonish Jandice in “Masterminds,” her husband died from a snake bite; at his funeral, she fell in love with his “distant cousin.”\\n\\nAnd as Morgan in “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” her biography includes getting deported from Belize, doing cocaine with her basketball coach, being the target of Mandy Patinkin’s advances, discussing penis preferences with her mom and inviting a magician to live in her grandmother’s condo.\\n\\nLionsgate Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis in \"The Spy Who Dumped Me.\"\\n\\nInstead of giving her characters depth, screenwriters give them anecdotes. McKinnon delivers lines like these matter-of-factly, as if anyone who doesn’t relate is a freak ― a convincing way to tap into the irony of her full-bodied ebullience. She plays walking scrapbooks overflowing with uproarious one-liners and wacky reaction shots, having become a go-to for nimble physical humor that evokes Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey. But those performers’ manic verve had sell-by dates: Ball’s attempts to re-create the joys of “I Love Lucy” never quite worked, Paramount Pictures eventually declined to renew Lewis’ contract, and Carrey grew tired of being a tool for box-office capital.\\n\\nOr perhaps it’s more apt to compare McKinnon to her “SNL” predecessors. Take, for example, Will Ferrell, inarguably one of the biggest movie stars the sketch series has produced. Ferrell and McKinnon share a penchant for visceral oddballs, but a few things set them apart. First, Ferrell gets to headline movies, whereas McKinnon is always second fiddle. (The entire plot of “The Spy Who Dumped Me” revolves around Mila Kunis.) Secondly, Ferrell’s lead roles, however silly they may be, have proper arcs with family histories and detailed psychologies (see: “Elf,” “Talladega Nights,” “Step Brothers”). And finally, Ferrell ― like Kristen Wiig, Adam Sandler and Bill Murray ― has evidenced that he is more than a one-trick pony by taking astute roles in thoughtful character studies (see: “Stranger Than Fiction,” “Everything Must Go”).\\n\\nMcKinnon, on the other hand, has so far been pigeonholed as little more than the resident nut job, tasked with making googly eyes or thinning her voice to steal scenes in unremarkable chaos comedies.\\n\\nSony Chris Hemsworth, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig in \"Ghostbusters.\"\\n\\nSooner or later, that schtick runs thin for even the sharpest performers. Even Eddie Murphy, once a supreme movie star, descended from “Beverly Hills Cop” to “Daddy Day Care.” And McKinnon, like Murphy before her, is far too good for that. She deserves a part that doesn’t feel like an “SNL” bit pushed beyond its limits, where the musicality of her voice and the dementedness of her dexterity are more than devices for cheap chuckles.\\n\\n“The Spy Who Dumped Me,” directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel (“Life Partners”), is the ultimate example of this. In “Spy,” an action comedy with a third act that has far too much action and hardly enough comedy, Morgan is the daring BFF who can drop everything to delve into international assassin mayhem that really has nothing to do with her.\\n\\nMorgan doesn’t have much to offer the plot beyond aiding Kunis’ Audrey, so she enlists the help of onetime flame Edward Snowden to take down the crime syndicate that Audrey is wrapped up with. Like most of McKinnon’s big-screen characters, Morgan has an impressive sexual prowess, but it’s only evidenced with an implicit wink. She can’t have normal relationships, no way; she needs to have the world’s most famous dissident on speed dial.\\n\\nThere’s a key moment in “Spy” that presents a unified theory of the Kate McKinnon Cinematic Universe. Speaking, rather rudely, for everyone who comes in contact with a feature-length McKinnon character, Audrey’s boyfriend (Justin Theroux) tells her she is “a little much.”\\n\\nSony Zoë Kravitz, Jillian Bell, Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in \"Rough Night.\"\\n\\nIn that one line, the movie reveals that it knows it’s resting on McKinnon’s antics ― and that “Ghostbusters,” “Office Christmas Party,” “Masterminds” and “Rough Night” knew too. They wanted her to be too much. They insisted on it. Is she good for anything else? These projects wouldn’t know.\\n\\nIn a rare emotional exchange toward the end of “Spy,” Morgan concedes that her career isn’t thriving and she fears everyone thinks she’s “a little much.” Because it’s so far removed from anything we’ve seen of Morgan in the previous 100 minutes, the sentiment barely lands.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'There may be a deeper reason behind Angelina Jolie getting nasty in her custody battle with Brad Pitt, as a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that going ‘ice queen’ is a way to cope with a broken heart!\\n\\nAngelina Jolie, 43, “really hasn’t come to terms with her heartbreak” over her split from Brad Pitt, 54, a source close to the Maleficent actress EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “She’s not in a place where she want to admit, it but the loss of their love is still haunting her. They had such a passionate love affair. It’s not something that’s easy for her to get over, not without a fight to match the size of their love. The fact is, Angelina’s deeply hurt that they couldn’t keep things together and have their happy Hollywood ending and she puts all the blame for that failure on Brad.”\\n\\nPerhaps this explains the nasty turn Brad and Angelina’s custody battle has taken, with her lobbing allegations of unpaid child support at her ex. “Instead of facing her sadness and working through it,” the source tells HollywoodLife.com, “her coping mechanism is to go full ice queen. Sadly it is the only way she can get through this divorce. If she doesn’t focus on her anger and stay in that frame of mind, she would crumble and possibly even have a breakdown.”\\n\\n“That’s just not an option” for Angie, the source added. “She has to stay strong for her kids and unfortunately for Brad, ‘staying strong’ means ‘staying angry.’ “ Angie’s anger, while helping her keep it together for her kids, but actually backfire and cost her the one thing she’s trying to protect.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nWe should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009. If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.\\n\\nSenators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.\\n\\nI cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won\\'t be available by the end of the month, we won\\'t have reliable answers to any of those questions.\\n\\nI take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill\\'s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.\\n\\nI hope that in the months ahead, we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and serves the interests of Americans as best we can.', 'source': 'http://www.politico.com', 'publish_date': '1506063600.0', 'url': 'www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/full-statement-john-mccain-on-voting-no-on-graham-cassidy-243030', 'canonical_link': 'https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/full-statement-john-mccain-on-voting-no-on-graham-cassidy-243030', 'authors': ['Burgess Everett', 'Jennifer Haberkorn', 'Jeremy B.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': '\"Despacito\" ( American Spanish: [despa\\'sito]; English: \"Slowly\") is a song by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee from Fonsi\\'s upcoming studio album.[1] On January 12, 2017, Universal Music Latin released \"Despacito\" and its music video, which shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and the local bar La Factoría. The song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres. A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the song\\'s chart performance in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. \"Despacito\" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market again.\\n\\nIt is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about having a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others, making it both Fonsi\\'s and Daddy Yankee\\'s most successful single to date. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since \"Macarena\" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-reigning number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 55 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. In August 2017, the official music video for \"Despacito\" became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time after receiving its three billionth view. It became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, and five billion views.\\n\\nUpon its release, \"Despacito\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. The remix version has received three Grammy Awards nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\npictured) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi. Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender ) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi.\\n\\nAfter two years without releasing new music, Luis Fonsi wanted to create \"a fun track that had that Latin feel with a melody that I feel very comfortable singing and that will make people just dance.\"[2][3] The lyrics were born in late 2015 in Fonsi\\'s house after he expressed his desire to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album.[4] Brazilian-Panamenian singer and songwriter Erika Ender, a Latin Grammy Award-winner, went to Luis Fonsi\\'s house in Miami, who said to her that he woke up mulling about \"writing a song called \\'Despacito\\'.\"[5][6] Fonsi sang the lines \"Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico\", Ender replied \"Hasta que las olas griten \\'Ay Bendito\\'\" and then they began to build the song.[6] The Puerto Rico line was moved to the end of the song in order to not sound \"so regional\" and they started writing a story.[6]\\n\\nFonsi originally composed \"Despacito\" as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but began to consider giving it an \"urban injection\" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee through WhatsApp, who agreed to collaborate on the song after Fonsi played him the demo.[3][7] Prior to collaborating on \"Despacito\", Fonsi and Daddy Yankee had worked together on \"Una Oportunidad\", released digitally in 2010.[8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse while thinking about his father playing bongos at his house, citing that as \"percussion attacks,\" and wrote the post-chorus or hook.[9][10][11] They recorded the song in Miami in 2016.[12] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thalía, and Ricky Martin, among various Latin acts.[13][14][15]\\n\\nOriginally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs of his album after making the demo of \"Despacito\".[16] Andrés Torres said that the track \"kept getting postponed\" because \"there was always some issue with [it].\"[17] After showing the demo to his producers, they and Fonsi decided to focus on \"Despacito\" and leave the other works aside.[16] He stated that both Daddy Yankee and he were surprised after hearing the final song because it sounded \"powerful, fresh and different.\"[16] Luis Fonsi said that he does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.\"[3] He also affirmed that Daddy Yankee\\'s work was a plus to the song because \"it needed that explosion that only he can bring to the table.\"[3] Mauricio Rengifo expressed that the song \"really took 100 percent shape the day Yankee recorded.\"[17] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted.\"[6]\\n\\nFonsi stated that he made \"Despacito\" a danceable song because \"Latinos are known for being happy people\" and that he feels the need of happy music.[18] He added that the \"urban feel\" in the song\\'s rhythm is the type that \"[us Latinos] breathe in and out\" and that it is \"a synonym of party.\"[18] According to him, \"Despacito\" is a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[18] In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erika Ender stated that the track \"made a special connection\" and that the collaboration with Daddy Yankee was \"a great idea.\"[4] She also said that because of the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and that her approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste.\"[4] During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song\\'s release interfering with the launch of his album Fénix.[17][19][20]\\n\\nComposition\\n\\n\"Despacito\" A 22-second sample of \"Despacito\" featuring part of the chorus. Problems playing this file? See media help.\\n\\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton[21][22] and Latin pop[23][24] song composed in common time (4\\n\\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm—G—D—A.[25] The vocals span from F# 4 to A 5 .[26] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[27][28] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[29][30]\\n\\nMauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and its final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[31] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[31] Nieves plays salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains vocal samples and \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[31] Percussion instruments guache and güira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track\\'s cumbia influences.[31] The song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent,\" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[32] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[32] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, güira, and sequenced drum patterns.[31]\\n\\nRelease and reception\\n\\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin.[33] It was released physically on April 30, 2017 in Europe as a 2-track single including the original and pop version.[34] Some music publications believed the single\\'s success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music after the release of hit singles by Nicky Jam, Thalia, Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin and Shakira.[35] Fonsi considered the trend to be \"the new pop\", and Ender said of it, \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[2][4] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don\\'t call. People who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him it was a \"home run.\"[36]\\n\\nThe song was well received from music critics. Doris Irizarry of AXS praised the fusion between \"Latin sensual rhythms\" and urban music, describing it as \"masterful.\"[37] Sebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts electronic journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[38] He added that \"\\'Despacito\\' has the magic it takes to reach the world\" and that \"works both on the dancefloors and on the radio.\"[38] Buddy Iahn of The Music Universe described it as an \"infectious tune\" and expressed that its music video became very popular because it is \"great music performed by two of the biggest stars in the Latin music business.\"[39] Diana Marti of E! News said that \"it is almost impossible not to dance to [it].\"[40] Caroline Soriano of Enstars magazine described the song\\'s beat as \"quite sexy and catchy\" and defined the lyrics as \"captivating.\"[41] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone magazine described it as alluring, sexy and catchy.[12] Leila Cobo of Billboard expressed that \"Despacito\" is \"a great pop song\", highlighting the \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" of the pre-chorus and the chorus.[42] Cobo also stated that it \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat, subtly naughty lyrics, a rapper’s contemporary edge and an irresistible chorus that can be applied to so many situations.\"[43]\\n\\nRobert Joffred of Medium\\'s culture blog That Good You Need stated in his review that the song has \"something [very] interesting happening\" and that it can be classified as a Latin-American song because of its composition and characteristics.[32] He highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, on which flamenco is usually played, representing \"a modern take on a historical musical style.\"[32] Joffred also stated that what makes \"Despacito\" a \"great song\" is that it \"throws decades of tradition to the wind in a very subtle way\" because of the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus.[32] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius.\"[32] Petra Rivera-Rideau, author of Remixing Reggaetón: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico (2015), said that she \"really likes\" the song and that it is \"super catchy.\"[44] She also stated that \"what\\'s great about \\'Despacito\\' is that it shows reggaeton never really went away\" and that the song\\'s success \"makes [her] really excited to see what’s going to happen next.\"[44] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.\"[45]\\n\\nSpanish record producer Nahúm García stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\", referring to the first time Luis Fonsi performs the word \"Despacito\".[46] He explained that \"the brain realizes that there has been a rare breakdown and it catches its eye\",[46] and claimed that this \"trick\" in particular is not very common \"and much less in pop music.\"[46] García concluded stating that the song \"is very well made.\"[46] James Kellaris, composer and professor at the University of Cincinnati\\'s business school,[47] expressed that \"\\'Despacito\\' contains earworm elements\" for being \"cheerful, simple, repetitive and having a sticky rhythm.\"[46] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics after being translated to English, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive.\"[48] Christian Koch of The Culture Trip also referred to the lyrics as \"creepy.\"[49]\\n\\nAccolades\\n\\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success. The remix version received three nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Grammy Awards.[50] The original version won three awards at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video, while the remix version won Best Urban Fusion/Performance.[51] It won Collaboration of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Song and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 45th American Music Awards.[52] The song was also nominated for three Latin American Music Awards and an MTV Video Music Award.[53][54][55] The Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame recognized \"Despacito\" as the Song of the Year at its 5th La Musa Awards.[56] It has also won two Teen Choice Awards, two Premios Juventud, and an NRJ Music Award.[57][58][59] In 2018, the remix version received six Billboard Latin Music Awards and five Billboard Music Awards, including Top Hot 100 Song.[60] It has also received an ASCAP Latin Music Award for Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers at the 26th ASCAP Latin Music Awards.[61][62] Erika Ender became the youngest person to be inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame and the first female Latin artist to garner a Grammy Award for Song of the Year nomination.[56][63]\\n\\nIn 2017, Billboard\\'s critics ranked \"Despacito\" the fourth best song and the best Latin song of 2017 and the fifth best Latin song of all-time, referring to it as \"one of the biggest hits in Latin music history\" and \"one of the biggest singles of all time.\"[65][66][67] Rolling Stone positioned it the seventh best song of 2017, stating that it became \"your suburban grandmother\\'s favorite Spanish-language song since \\'La Bamba\\'.\"[68] Time ranked it the third best song of 2017, closing a brief review by stating that \"in a year where xenophobia reared its head worldwide, it inspires hope that the charts were dominated by such a universal, multicultural hit.\"[45] The remix version alone was ranked the 29th and 38th best song of 2017 by Noise magazine and Spin, respectively; the latter stating that \"it managed to transcend genre, time, space, and even personal taste in a way that was unprecedented.\"[69][70] It was also ranked the 20th and 21st best song of 2017 by PopSugar and The New York Times, respectively.[71][72]

Far\" list by Rolling Stone.[74] The following month, the magazine included \"Despacito\" in its \"50 Greatest Latin Pop Songs\" list, describing it as \"the undeniable all-time champion of Latin pop\" and \"one of the most successful hits in pop music history.\"[75] In August 2018, Billboard selected it among the best Latin summer songs of all-time, referring to the track as a \"classic.\"[76]\\n\\nControversies\\n\\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that \"Despacito\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[77] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were \"not suitable to be heard.\"[77]\\n\\nCommercial performance\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nIn the United States, the single debuted at number two on the Hot Latin Songs chart on February 4, 2017, becoming Fonsi\\'s highest-charting single since June 13, 2009, when \"Aquí Estoy

The song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres. A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the song\\'s chart performance in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. \"Despacito\" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market again.\\n\\nIt is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about having a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others, making it both Fonsi\\'s and Daddy Yankee\\'s most successful single to date. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since \"Macarena\" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-reigning number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 55 weeks.

It became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, and five billion views.\\n\\nUpon its release, \"Despacito\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. The remix version has received three Grammy Awards nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\npictured) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi. Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender ) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi.\\n\\nAfter two years without releasing new music, Luis Fonsi wanted to create \"a fun track that had that Latin feel with a melody that I feel very comfortable singing and that will make people just dance.\"[2][3] The lyrics were born in late 2015 in Fonsi\\'s house after he expressed his desire to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album.[4] Brazilian-Panamenian singer and songwriter Erika Ender, a Latin Grammy Award-winner, went to Luis Fonsi\\'s house in Miami, who said to her that he woke up mulling about \"writing a song called \\'Despacito\\'.\"[5][6] Fonsi sang the lines \"Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico\", Ender replied \"Hasta que las olas griten \\'Ay Bendito\\'\" and then they began to build the song.[6] The Puerto Rico line was moved to the end of the song in order to not sound \"so regional\" and they started writing a story.[6]\\n\\nFonsi originally composed \"Despacito\" as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but began to consider giving it an \"urban injection\" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee through WhatsApp, who agreed to collaborate on the song after Fonsi played him the demo.[3][7] Prior to collaborating on \"Despacito\", Fonsi and Daddy Yankee had worked together on \"Una Oportunidad\", released digitally in 2010.[8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse while thinking about his father playing bongos at his house, citing that as \"percussion attacks,\" and wrote the post-chorus or hook.[9][10][11] They recorded the song in Miami in 2016.[12] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thalía, and Ricky Martin, among various Latin acts.[13][14][15]\\n\\nOriginally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs of his album after making the demo of \"Despacito\".[16] Andrés Torres said that the track \"kept getting postponed\" because \"there was always some issue with [it].\"[17] After showing the demo to his producers, they and Fonsi decided to focus on \"Despacito\" and leave the other works aside.[16] He stated that both Daddy Yankee and he were surprised after hearing the final song because it sounded \"powerful, fresh and different.\"[16] Luis Fonsi said that he does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.\"[3] He also affirmed that Daddy Yankee\\'s work was a plus to the song because \"it needed that explosion that only he can bring to the table.\"[3] Mauricio Rengifo expressed that the song \"really took 100 percent shape the day Yankee recorded.\"[17] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted.\"[6]\\n\\nFonsi stated that he made \"Despacito\" a danceable song because \"Latinos are known for being happy people\" and that he feels the need of happy music.[18] He added that the \"urban feel\" in the song\\'s rhythm is the type that \"[us Latinos] breathe in and out\" and that it is \"a synonym of party.\"[18] According to him, \"Despacito\" is a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[18] In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erika Ender stated that the track \"made a special connection\" and that the collaboration with Daddy Yankee was \"a great idea.\"[4] She also said that because of the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and that her approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste.\"[4] During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song\\'s release interfering with the launch of his album Fénix.[17][19][20]\\n\\nComposition\\n\\n\"Despacito\" A 22-second sample of \"Despacito\" featuring part of the chorus. Problems playing this file? See media help.\\n\\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton[21][22] and Latin pop[23][24] song composed in common time (4\\n\\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm—G—D—A.[25] The vocals span from F# 4 to A 5 .[26] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[27][28] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[29][30]\\n\\nMauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and its final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[31] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[31] Nieves plays salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains vocal samples and \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[31] Percussion instruments guache and güira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track\\'s cumbia influences.[31] The song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent,\" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[32] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[32] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, güira, and sequenced drum patterns.[31]\\n\\nRelease and reception\\n\\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin.[33] It was released physically on April 30, 2017 in Europe as a 2-track single including the original and pop version.[34] Some music publications believed the single\\'s success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music after the release of hit singles by Nicky Jam, Thalia, Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin and Shakira.[35] Fonsi considered the trend to be \"the new pop\", and Ender said of it, \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[2][4] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don\\'t call. People who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him it was a \"home run.\"[36]\\n\\nThe song was well received from music critics. Doris Irizarry of AXS praised the fusion between \"Latin sensual rhythms\" and urban music, describing it as \"masterful.\"[37] Sebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts electronic journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[38] He added that \"\\'Despacito\\' has the magic it takes to reach the world\" and that \"works both on the dancefloors and on the radio.\"[38] Buddy Iahn of The Music Universe described it as an \"infectious tune\" and expressed that its music video became very popular because it is \"great music performed by two of the biggest stars in the Latin music business.\"[39] Diana Marti of E! News said that \"it is almost impossible not to dance to [it].\"[40] Caroline Soriano of Enstars magazine described the song\\'s beat as \"quite sexy and catchy\" and defined the lyrics as \"captivating.\"[41] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone magazine described it as alluring, sexy and catchy.[12] Leila Cobo of Billboard expressed that \"Despacito\" is \"a great pop song\", highlighting the \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" of the pre-chorus and the chorus.[42] Cobo also stated that it \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat, subtly naughty lyrics, a rapper’s contemporary edge and an irresistible chorus that can be applied to so many situations.\"[43]\\n\\nRobert Joffred of Medium\\'s culture blog That Good You Need stated in his review that the song has \"something [very] interesting happening\" and that it can be classified as a Latin-American song because of its composition and characteristics.[32] He highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, on which flamenco is usually played, representing \"a modern take on a historical musical style.\"[32] Joffred also stated that what makes \"Despacito\" a \"great song\" is that it \"throws decades of tradition to the wind in a very subtle way\" because of the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus.[32] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius.\"[32] Petra Rivera-Rideau, author of Remixing Reggaetón: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico (2015), said that she \"really likes\" the song and that it is \"super catchy.\"[44] She also stated that \"what\\'s great about \\'Despacito\\' is that it shows reggaeton never really went away\" and that the song\\'s success \"makes [her] really excited to see what’s going to happen next.\"[44] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.\"[45]\\n\\nSpanish record producer Nahúm García stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\", referring to the first time Luis Fonsi performs the word \"Despacito\".[46] He explained that \"the brain realizes that there has been a rare breakdown and it catches its eye\",[46] and claimed that this \"trick\" in particular is not very common \"and much less in pop music.\"[46] García concluded stating that the song \"is very well made.\"[46] James Kellaris, composer and professor at the University of Cincinnati\\'s business school,[47] expressed that \"\\'Despacito\\' contains earworm elements\" for being \"cheerful, simple, repetitive and having a sticky rhythm.\"[46] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics after being translated to English, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive.\"[48] Christian Koch of The Culture Trip also referred to the lyrics as \"creepy.\"[49]\\n\\nAccolades\\n\\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success.

August 2018, Billboard affirmed that the song\\'s influence has impacted other Latin crossovers, including \"Mi Gente\".[174]\\n\\nThe Recording Industry Association of America reported in April 2018 that Latin music revenues grew 37% in 2017, \"driven primarily by music streaming,\" whose revenue increased 84% compared to 2016.[175] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that revenue in Latin America grew 17.7% in 2017, \"driven largely by a 48.9% increase in streaming revenues that helped offset a 41.5% decline in physical revenue.\"[157] \"Despacito\" has been described by the IFPI as \"a game-changing hit from Latin America to the world\" and declared it \"the song of 2017.\"[157] IFPI\\'s chief executive Frances Moore described the song as a \"global smash hit\" and related its success with \"the broadening appeal of Latin music.\"[157] In July 2018, Billboard reported that Latin music\\'s consumption in the United States increased 15% between the first half of 2016 and the first half of 2018, directly relating it with the success of \"Despacito\" during 2017.[176]\\n\\nSocial impact\\n\\nShortly after the original version\\'s success, an Argentine band composed of football club San Lorenzo de Almagro\\'s fans reworked the song in order to chant it during matches, and its positive reception on the Internet rebounded in fans from other Argentine clubs and other countries, including Brazil, Uruguay, Tunisia, Israel, and Korea, to make their own version.[177] Martino Simcik of The Guardian referred to the situation as \"the song\\'s rebirth as a football anthem\" and stated that \"while the antics of a forgetful pop star created a divisive association with the song, football fans have made it an ode to our collective passion.\"[177]\\n\\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[178][179] Tour operators cite the song\\'s music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factoría and La Perla district in Old San Juan, which were featured in the video.[180]\\n\\nMusic video\\n\\nBackground\\n\\n2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera co-starred the music video.\\n\\nThe music video for \"Despacito\" was directed by Puerto Rican director Carlos Pérez and produced by Joanna Egozcue and Roxy Quiñones.[181] Filming took place in December 2016 in La Perla neighborhood and the popular bar La Factoría in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[181] Carlos Pérez had previously worked with Luis Fonsi on \"Corazón en la Maleta\" (2014) and also with Daddy Yankee on clips including \"Gasolina\" (2004), \"Rompe\" (2005), \"Gangsta Zone\" (2006), \"Descontrol\" (2010), and \"Ven Conmigo\" (2011), among others.[182] Puerto Rican cinematographer Thomas Marvel and Puerto Rican stylist Yasiri Castro have also worked on the music video.[183]\\n\\nWanting Carlos Pérez to direct the clip, Luis Fonsi reached him the song and wanted to make \"something special.\" According to Fonsi, Pérez was impressed with the track after listening to it, and showed interest in the project.[36] Fonsi then called 2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera, wanting her to represent \"the Latina powerful woman.\" She called him back 10 minutes later and replied that it was \"the best song she had ever heard.\"[36]\\n\\nFonsi stated that the music video celebrates Latin American culture, saying that movement, dancing and rhythm are \"engraved into his bones.\" He also affirms that part of the song\\'s success was the reception of the fans, capturing the best of Fonsi\\'s romantic ballad and danceable facets.[18] Carlos Perez stated that the clip \"directly supports the vibe of the song\" and that it \"is a video that has soul to it.\"[184] Jorge Muñíz Ortíz of Agencia EFE stated that the music video \"highlights some of the main cultural and folkloric symbols of Puerto Rico\" by showing its \"splendid beaches, the colorful landscape of La Perla, the rattle of the Puerto Rican cuatro and the barrels of the autochthonous genre of bomba, even Zuleyka Rivera\\'s hips movement, and a pair of men enjoying a game of dominoes.\"[7]\\n\\nOn April 10, 2018, Luis Fonsi\\'s YouTube Vevo account was hacked by an anonymous group, who removed the music video for \"Despacito\" from his channel for hours before becoming available again.[185] BBC News reported that clips from more than a dozen Vevo channels, including those of Drake, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Shakira, were also affected.[186] The hackers stated that \"the act was not malicious, but just in good fun.\"[186]\\n\\nSynopsis\\n\\nThe video shows both artists performing the song while participating on different parties on the island, featuring model Zuleyka Rivera.[187] The clip starts with shots of La Perla\\'s coast during daylight while showing Zuleyka Rivera arriving at the shanty town on foot. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee perform the song in a street while elders are playing dominos, a child is getting his hair cut, two people are talking while listening to the radio, and couples are dancing in the background. The video intercalates with shots of Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing in front of a car with people sitting on it and dancing next to it. As Daddy Yankee is finishing his verse, Zuleyka Rivera enters La Factoría bar while the artists are performing and dancing alongside other people, and men are playing bomba drums.[7] Fonsi proceeds to dance with Rivera as the song ends. The outro consists of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing the hook a cappella with the people at the bar.[7]\\n\\nPerformance and accolades\\n\\nThe official music video on YouTube was released on Fonsi\\'s channel on January 12, 2017[78][188] and amassed one billion views in 97 days,[189] becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone behind the music video for Adele\\'s \"Hello\".[190] The video received two billion views in 154 days, surpassing Justin Bieber\\'s record of 394 days with the music video for his song \"Sorry\" to become the fastest video on the site to reach the milestone.[191] The video became the first on YouTube to receive three billion, four billion, and five billion views on August 4, 2017; October 11, 2017; and April 5, 2018, respectively (dates are based on UTC).[192][193][194] It has received over 5.4 billion views as of August 10, 2018[188] and has been the most viewed video on the site since August 4, 2017, when it surpassed the music video for \"See You Again\" by Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth.[195] It is also the site\\'s most-liked video, with over 27 million as of May 3, 2018.[196] On Vevo, the music video received 5.14 million views in its first 24 hours of release, which the website reported as being the most for a Spanish-language video\\'s first day on its platform, surpassing J Balvin\\'s record with the music video for his song \"Bobo\".[78]\\n\\nThe music video received a Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards and a Billboard Music Award for Top Streaming Song (Video) at the 25th Billboard Music Awards, and was nominated for an American Music Award for Video of the Year at the 45th American Music Awards.[51][52][64]\\n\\nLive performances\\n\\nThe first stage performance of \"Despacito\" was by Daddy Yankee solo in Merida, Mexico on February 27, 2017, while Fonsi performed the pop version on the L Festival on March 18, 2017 at the Pico Rivera Sports Arena in Pico Rivera, California.[197][198] Justin Bieber performed the remix version in Puerto Rico on April 18, 2017 on his Purpose World Tour with Luis Fonsi as guest.[199] Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed \"Despacito\" live together for the first time at the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Awards on April 27, 2017.[200] They performed together again on The Voice season 12 finals featuring contestant Mark Isaiah on May 23, 2017.[201] On June 12, 2017, Luis Fonsi performed solo on Conan, a talk show hosted by Conan O\\'Brien, being his first late-night television appearance in the United States.[202]\\n\\nDaddy Yankee included the song on the setlist for his Tamo En Vivo Europe Tour, which lasted from June 2 to July 9, 2017.[203][204] Fonsi also included \"Despacito\" on his Love + Dance World Tour, which began on July 1, 2017.[205] On September 14, 2017, Luis Fonsi performed the single on the American talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[206] Erika Ender also performed an acoustic version of the song during a Billboard session on September 18, 2017 in order to promote her album Tatuajes.[207] On November 16, 2017, Luis Fonsi performed the song featuring Puerto Rican musician Victor Manuelle, Colombian band Bomba Estéreo, and American disc jockey Diplo at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards.[208] Erika Ender and Brazilian singer-songwriter Roberto Carlos performed an acoustic version featuring drummers and dancers from Beija-Flor Samba school in Brazil on November 29, 2017.[209][210]\\n\\nOn January 28, 2018, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed the song at the 60th Grammy Awards on the Madison Square Garden, becoming the 12th and 13th Latin artists to perform at the Grammy Awards.[211][212] Luis Fonsi performed it at the 59th Viña del Mar International Song Festival on February 21, 2018.[213] Four days later, he performed an orchestral version with the Teatro Colón Orchestra at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Argentina.[214]\\n\\nRemixes\\n\\nJustin Bieber remix version\\n\\nOn April 17, 2017 a remix version featuring vocals by Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released, who sang in Spanish for the first time in his career.[220][221] The remix was released as a single by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and School Boy Records.[82][222] The song maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee\\'s verses were kept from the original version.[220] It was the first collaboration between Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee with Bieber.

Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender ) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi.\\n\\nAfter two years without releasing new music, Luis Fonsi wanted to create \"a fun track that had that Latin feel with a melody that I feel very comfortable singing and that will make people just dance.\"[2][3] The lyrics were born in late 2015 in Fonsi\\'s house after he expressed his desire to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album.[4] Brazilian-Panamenian singer and songwriter Erika Ender, a Latin Grammy Award-winner, went to Luis Fonsi\\'s house in Miami, who said to her that he woke up mulling about \"writing a song called \\'Despacito\\'.\"[5][6] Fonsi sang the lines \"Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico\", Ender replied \"Hasta que las olas griten \\'Ay Bendito\\'\" and then they began to build the song.[6] The Puerto Rico line was moved to the end of the song in order to not sound \"so regional\" and they started writing a story.[6]\\n\\nFonsi originally composed \"Despacito\" as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but began to consider giving it an \"urban injection\" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee through WhatsApp, who agreed to collaborate on the song after Fonsi played him the demo.[3][7] Prior to collaborating on \"Despacito\", Fonsi and Daddy Yankee had worked together on \"Una Oportunidad\", released digitally in 2010.[8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse while thinking about his father playing bongos at his house, citing that as \"percussion attacks,\" and wrote the post-chorus or hook.[9][10][11] They recorded the song in Miami in 2016.[12] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thalía, and Ricky Martin, among various Latin acts.[13][14][15]\\n\\nOriginally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs of his album after making the demo of \"Despacito\".[16] Andrés Torres said that the track \"kept getting postponed\" because \"there was always some issue with [it].\"[17] After showing the demo to his producers, they and Fonsi decided to focus on \"Despacito\" and leave the other works aside.[16] He stated that both Daddy Yankee and he were surprised after hearing the final song because it sounded \"powerful, fresh and different.\"[16] Luis Fonsi said that he does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.\"[3] He also affirmed that Daddy Yankee\\'s work was a plus to the song because \"it needed that explosion that only he can bring to the table.\"[3] Mauricio Rengifo expressed that the song \"really took 100 percent shape the day Yankee recorded.\"[17] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted.\"[6]\\n\\nFonsi stated that he made \"Despacito\" a danceable song because \"Latinos are known for being happy people\" and that he feels the need of happy music.[18] He added that the \"urban feel\" in the song\\'s rhythm is the type that \"[us Latinos] breathe in and out\" and that it is \"a synonym of party.\"[18] According to him, \"Despacito\" is a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[18] In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erika Ender stated that the track \"made a special connection\" and that the collaboration with Daddy Yankee was \"a great idea.\"[4] She also said that because of the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and that her approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste.\"[4] During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song\\'s release interfering with the launch of his album Fénix.[17][19][20]\\n\\nComposition\\n\\n\"Despacito\" A 22-second sample of \"Despacito\" featuring part of the chorus.

See media help.\\n\\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton[21][22] and Latin pop[23][24] song composed in common time (4\\n\\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm—G—D—A.[25] The vocals span from F# 4 to A 5 .[26] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[27][28] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[29][30]\\n\\nMauricio Rengifo and Andrés Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and its final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[31] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[31] Nieves plays salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains vocal samples and \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[31] Percussion instruments guache and güira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track\\'s cumbia influences.[31] The song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent,\" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[32] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[32] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, güira, and sequenced drum patterns.[31]\\n\\nRelease and reception\\n\\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin.[33] It was released physically on April 30, 2017 in Europe as a 2-track single including the original and pop version.[34] Some music publications believed the single\\'s success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music after the release of hit singles by Nicky Jam, Thalia, Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin and Shakira.[35] Fonsi considered the trend to be \"the new pop\", and Ender said of it, \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[2][4] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don\\'t call. People who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him it was a \"home run.\"[36]\\n\\nThe song was well received from music critics. Doris Irizarry of AXS praised the fusion between \"Latin sensual rhythms\" and urban music, describing it as \"masterful.\"[37] Sebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts electronic journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[38] He added that \"\\'Despacito\\' has the magic it takes to reach the world\" and that \"works both on the dancefloors and on the radio.\"[38] Buddy Iahn of The Music Universe described it as an \"infectious tune\" and expressed that its music video became very popular because it is \"great music performed by two of the biggest stars in the Latin music business.\"[39] Diana Marti of E!

for voting in the controversial Constitutional Assembly election.[256] Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in

listen to it and enjoy it, not to use it as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people that are crying out for their freedom and a better future.\"[260] Despite the criticism by the

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'On the same day rumors spread that there’s trouble in paradise for Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, another shocking report claims Miranda Lambert is desperately trying to meet up with her ex!\\n\\nIt’s been more than two years since Blake Shelton, 40, and Miranda Lambert, 33, ended their marriage, but she’s finally ready to sit down and hash things out, according to a new report. Amidst new rumors that Blake is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stefani, 47, an insider tells InTouch that Miranda wants to confront her ex to finally get closure. “It needs to be done,” the source tells the mag. “There’s still a lot of unfinished business between [Miranda] and Blake. She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”\\n\\nThere are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.\\n\\n“She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'With Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s split announcement, fans are dying for her to get back together with ex husband Brad Pitt. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how he wants to be left out of it all.\\n\\nSeriously, when you heard Jennifer Aniston‘s two year marriage to Justin Theroux, 46, was ending was your first thought “will she end up with Brad Pitt again?” The 54-year-old is single after splitting from ex-wife Angelina Jolie 42, in 2016 and the Twittersphere would love to see the former Hollywood golden couple reunite. While fan are freaking over the very idea of a Brad/Jen reunion, the actor is dreading all of the new gossip scenarios that are coming with his 49-year-old ex coming back on the market. “Brad knows it’s difficult for any one when they go through a separation, but he’s not happy that his name will be linked with hers again in all the coverage of Jen’s separation,” a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\\n\\n“He’d love to be far removed from it, but he knows he will be in the center of the tornado and he will do his best to avoid it and not address it. But he also knows that will be impossible.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman was getting ready — brushing his teeth while listening to the nominations on his wife\\'s cell phone — as he prepared to head back to work on episode two of the NBC drama\\'s sophomore season when he learned of his show\\'s multiple mentions. The time-jumping family drama scored 11 total nominations — including best drama series, the first time a broadcast series has cracked the category since 2011.\\n\\n\"The emails are flying!\" Fogelman told THR early Thursday. \"We\\'re so busy right now that there\\'s not a lot of time to think … the feed was freezing and we didn\\'t quite understand what was happening. People were texting us ahead of us understanding what was going on!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFogelman noted that the way This Is Us is filmed — with members of the family working together in different scenes at any given time and not a lot of group scenes — will make getting the whole group together to celebrate complicated. \"There hasn\\'t been a lot of planning! I need to figure out how to get everyone together in some way — I\\'ve never done this before!\" the first-time nominee enthused. The busy producer was on his way to film on location Thursday and planned to find a way to head to the show\\'s L.A. set to celebrate properly with the production.\\n\\nOne thing that wasn\\'t lost on Fogelman: how challenging it is for programming that is both sentimental and heartfelt to cut through a cluttered landscape filled with dark dramas and anti-heroes. \"Normally if you have a sentiment in your show it\\'s not in the same conversation as darker fare, and if you have sentiment and comedy? That\\'s even more dangerous,\" he said, crediting stars including fellow nominees Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz, among others, for helping to elevate the content with serious performances. \"You actually feel like you\\'re watching something more weighty than it may be because the actors are so good. That\\'s why our show was able to cut through multiple conversations: it\\'s popular and critical.\"\\n\\nAs for what to expect when the 18-episode second season returns in the fall, Fogelman and company plan to lean deeper into the family\\'s drama. \"The family has big stories this season. The first season laid out the logistics of the family and in the second season, we\\'re able to dig deeper. We\\'re doing heavy duty stuff to understand the separation between Chrissy and Mandy Moore\\'s mother and daughter and why they feel so distant from each other.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Chris Brown reportedly does not want to raise his daughter in public light, like rapper Kanye West and reality TV star Kim Kardashian\\'s daughter, North West.\\n\\nAccording to Hollywood Life, the 25-year-old R&B singer, who allegedly has a nine-month-old baby girl named Royalty with long time friend and former model Nia Amey, wants to give the toddler a normal childhood.\\n\\n\"No disrespect to Kim or Kanye, Chris thinks they\\'re both talented and successful people at their respective craft.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'She reportedly thinks he\\'s \"The One.\"\\n\\nWhether they do it or not, most celebrities are able to keep their public persona and private relationships separate.\\n\\nTaylor Swift is not one of those people.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Swift, it’s impossible to talk about her career without also talking about her relationships, as she uses each and every one as inspiration for her songs. “It’s individual people that come into my life,” Swift has said about where she finds inspiration for her lyrics. “When I first started writing songs, I was always scared that my songs were too personal like, if I put someone’s name in a song, people won’t relate to it as much. But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I’m going through my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.”\\n\\nNot only has it connected her and her fans, but also leaves people dissecting each and every one of her songs to find out which of her romances they are about — and there are many to choose from.\\n\\nMost of Swift’s relationships haven’t been all that long-lasting, but they’ve all been known to fuel the tabloids along with rumors that they’re PR stunts. However, she’s managed to keep her most recent relationship with actor Joe Alwyn under wraps — but that doesn’t mean there isn’t some interesting stuff going on right under our noses!\\n\\n1. They dated for months without anyone knowing\\n\\nIn 2017, Swift all but disappeared from the public eye, which is weird for someone who until that point basically dominated the celebrity news cycle. A source close to Swift told People that she stepped away from the spotlight as “she felt like her personal life was spinning out of control.”\\n\\nDuring this time, Swift and Alwyn reportedly started dating unbeknownst to just about everyone. The Sun was the first to break the news about their relationship in May 2017 after they allegedly had already been together for months. “After what happened with Tom Hiddleston, they were determined to keep it quiet,” a source told The Sun. \"Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.”\\n\\n2. They started dating right after her breakup with Tom Hiddleston\\n\\nOut of all of Swift’s relationships, the one with Tom Hiddleston is probably the most bizarre. Though it only lasted three months, it was quite a whirlwind. Swift and Hiddleston broke up in September 2016, and it seems her relationship with Alwyn may have started in October of that year. \"She has been going back and forth between Nashville and the U.K. for the last few months while she has been recording her album,\" a source told E! Online.\\n\\n3. They’re rarely seen together\\n\\nDespite Swift being “crazy about Joe” and “really excited about their relationship,” it’s very rare that we catch a glimpse of them together — which is very unlike the country-pop crossover star. This leads us to believe Alwyn has something to do with the change of pace which, according to an insider, is likely the case. “Joe doesn\\'t like attention or have any interest in being a celebrity,” the source said, telling E! Online, \"She still intends to keep the relationship as private as possible. It\\'s sacred to her and she feels that keeping it to themselves has worked out for the best.”\\n\\n4. They haven\\'t walked the red carpet together\\n\\nIt’s one thing to avoid paparazzi, but throughout their relationship so far, Swift and Alwyn have also yet to walk a red carpet together. According to Hollywood Life, this is a deliberate way for the couple to keep their relationship together. “[Taylor]’s grown up a lot in the last few years and realizes how important it is to avoid being in the limelight 24/7 in order to maintain a stable, secure relationship,” a source reportedly said.\\n\\n5. He doesn’t want to be known as “Taylor Swift’s boyfriend”\\n\\nSwift is about as popular of a celebrity as you can be. And while Alwyn has started to up his status, he’s nowhere near the star Swift is — yet. And according to a source, he doesn’t want Swift’s celebrity to eclipse his talent.\\n\\n“Joe is determined to make it as an actor in his own right, and not to be known just as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend,” a source close to Joe reportedly told Hollywood Life. “Taylor is really supportive of Joe’s career, and totally understands why he doesn’t want to be a red carpet fixture with her.\\n\\n6. He puts his job over everything\\n\\nAlwyn’s acting career is still in its infancy, but he’s determined to make it in the industry. According to one of Alwyn’s former classmates, Alwyn is “married to his work.” It seems Swift knows this, though, and so far doesn’t mind. “Taylor loves that Joe is so dedicated to his career, and to making it big in his own name, and their relationship is all the happier for it,” a source told Hollywood Life.\\n\\n7. They might already be talking marriage\\n\\nIt seems as though all of Swift’s relationships up to this point have been lighthearted and fun (until they weren’t, of course, as we’ve learned in her lyrics). However, it seems she’s ready to get serious with Alwyn. In fact, a source told Us Weekly that she’s got marriage on the brain. “Taylor really believes Joe is the one for her,” an insider revealed. “She wants to get engaged to him.”\\n\\nMicki Spollen is a YourTango editor, writer, and traveler.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'She reportedly thinks he\\'s \"The One.\"\\n\\nWhether they do it or not, most celebrities are able to keep their public persona and private relationships separate.\\n\\nTaylor Swift is not one of those people.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Swift, it’s impossible to talk about her career without also talking about her relationships, as she uses each and every one as inspiration for her songs. “It’s individual people that come into my life,” Swift has said about where she finds inspiration for her lyrics. “When I first started writing songs, I was always scared that my songs were too personal like, if I put someone’s name in a song, people won’t relate to it as much. But what I saw happening was, if I let my fans into my life and my feelings and what I’m going through my vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities it turns out they have all those things, too, and it kind of connects us.”\\n\\nNot only has it connected her and her fans, but also leaves people dissecting each and every one of her songs to find out which of her romances they are about — and there are many to choose from.\\n\\nMost of Swift’s relationships haven’t been all that long-lasting, but they’ve all been known to fuel the tabloids along with rumors that they’re PR stunts. However, she’s managed to keep her most recent relationship with actor Joe Alwyn under wraps — but that doesn’t mean there isn’t some interesting stuff going on right under our noses!\\n\\n1. They dated for months without anyone knowing\\n\\nIn 2017, Swift all but disappeared from the public eye, which is weird for someone who until that point basically dominated the celebrity news cycle. A source close to Swift told People that she stepped away from the spotlight as “she felt like her personal life was spinning out of control.”\\n\\nDuring this time, Swift and Alwyn reportedly started dating unbeknownst to just about everyone. The Sun was the first to break the news about their relationship in May 2017 after they allegedly had already been together for months. “After what happened with Tom Hiddleston, they were determined to keep it quiet,” a source told The Sun. \"Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.”\\n\\n2. They started dating right after her breakup with Tom Hiddleston\\n\\nOut of all of Swift’s relationships, the one with Tom Hiddleston is probably the most bizarre. Though it only lasted three months, it was quite a whirlwind. Swift and Hiddleston broke up in September 2016, and it seems her relationship with Alwyn may have started in October of that year. \"She has been going back and forth between Nashville and the U.K. for the last few months while she has been recording her album,\" a source told E! Online.\\n\\n3. They’re rarely seen together\\n\\nDespite Swift being “crazy about Joe” and “really excited about their relationship,” it’s very rare that we catch a glimpse of them together — which is very unlike the country-pop crossover star. This leads us to believe Alwyn has something to do with the change of pace which, according to an insider, is likely the case. “Joe doesn\\'t like attention or have any interest in being a celebrity,” the source said, telling E! Online, \"She still intends to keep the relationship as private as possible. It\\'s sacred to her and she feels that keeping it to themselves has worked out for the best.”\\n\\n4. They haven\\'t walked the red carpet together\\n\\nIt’s one thing to avoid paparazzi, but throughout their relationship so far, Swift and Alwyn have also yet to walk a red carpet together. According to Hollywood Life, this is a deliberate way for the couple to keep their relationship together. “[Taylor]’s grown up a lot in the last few years and realizes how important it is to avoid being in the limelight 24/7 in order to maintain a stable, secure relationship,” a source reportedly said.\\n\\n5. He doesn’t want to be known as “Taylor Swift’s boyfriend”\\n\\nSwift is about as popular of a celebrity as you can be. And while Alwyn has started to up his status, he’s nowhere near the star Swift is — yet. And according to a source, he doesn’t want Swift’s celebrity to eclipse his talent.\\n\\n“Joe is determined to make it as an actor in his own right, and not to be known just as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend,” a source close to Joe reportedly told Hollywood Life. “Taylor is really supportive of Joe’s career, and totally understands why he doesn’t want to be a red carpet fixture with her.\\n\\n6.

Dating the director was different. We’d be on the [press] tour together, I’d come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie.”\\n\\n“He comes back from the tour, and that’s all he wants to talk about and I get it,” she continued. “It’s his baby.

Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.’ Especially because it’s my man,” she said. “It’s awesome, what we did — some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it’s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.”\\n\\nThe American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. “They get along really well,” a source told Us at the time.\\n\\nIn September, Lawrence spoke about the director in an interview with Vogue: “We had energy. I had energy for him. I don’t know how he felt about me,” Lawrence told the magazine. “For the past year, I’ve been dealing with him as just a human. I’ve been in relationships before where I am just confused. And I’m never confused with him.”\\n\\nThe Hunger Games actress has previously dated Nicholas Hoult and Coldplay’s Chris Martin.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'Well, this is a nice surprise. Halle Berry just dropped word via Instagram that the actress will be joining the cast of the third John Wick flick. Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the (presumably) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti-hero, but A) it\\'s cool that the (presumed) female lead will be about as old the male lead (she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27) and B) I\\'m a huge fan of Berry\\'s recent pulp fiction endeavors (The Call and Kidnap), so this is pretty cool casting.\\n\\nLionsgate also just announced that Angelica Houston, Asia Kate Dillon (TVs Billions and Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Lucky Day, Hawaii 5-0, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and Jason Mantzoukas (The Long Dumb Road, The House) will join the cast of John Wick: Chapter 3. Yes, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick will return as well. I\\'m not sure if Ruby Rose survived her encounters with Mr. Wick in part two, but I kinda hope she comes back too. What this arguably means is that Lionsgate may end up emphasizing an ensemble cast this time out, as opposed to the first two films which were (understandably) the Keanu Reeves Show.\\n\\nThat\\'s no shade on Mr. Wick or the actor who plays him, but as I noted in the last post about the Mission: Impossible franchise, there is perhaps a greater value, at least for overseas box office, in ensemble action flicks as opposed to solo/lone-wolf movies. Think Deadpool 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Fate of the Furious and Avengers: Infinity War. Even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was sold as a four-person adventure, highlighting Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.\\n\\nSo, if Lionsgate feels that they can get more overseas bucks the third-go around (John Wick: Chapter 2 made $92 million domestic and $79m overseas) by offering something resembling an ensemble cast, well, that\\'s one option on the table.

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)\\n\\nA younger-than-normal audience packed The View\\'s studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person.

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)\\n\\nA younger-than-normal audience packed The View\\'s studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift\\'s new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t necessarily nervous about this album,\" Swift said. \"I think my label might have been a little nervous but they\\'ll never say it now.\"\\n\\nSwift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.\\n\\n\"I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,\" Swift told the View co-hosts. \"I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn\\'t want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that\\'s never the intention.\"\\n\\nWith lyrics about empowerment and ridding one\\'s self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.\\n\\n\"It\\'s interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,\" Swift said. \"I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.\"\\n\\nWhether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.\\n\\n\"How do you not know how awesome you are?\" Nicolle Wallace asked.\\n\\n\"I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,\" said Swift.\\n\\nWatch the videos from Taylor Swift on The View below.\\n\\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1u8Qmx0', 'source': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'publish_date': '1414566000.0', 'url': 'www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/29/taylor-swift-calls-out-record-label-pop-album-1989/18140569/', 'canonical_link': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/29/taylor-swift-calls-out-record-label-pop-album-1989/18140569/', 'authors': [\"Ryan O'Connell\", 'Published P.M.

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)\\n\\nA younger-than-normal audience packed The View\\'s studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift\\'s new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t necessarily nervous about this album,\" Swift said. \"I think my label might have been a little nervous but they\\'ll never say it now.\"\\n\\nSwift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.\\n\\n\"I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,\" Swift told the View co-hosts. \"I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn\\'t want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that\\'s never the intention.\"\\n\\nWith lyrics about empowerment and ridding one\\'s self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.\\n\\n\"It\\'s interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,\" Swift said. \"I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.\"\\n\\nWhether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.\\n\\n\"How do you not know how awesome you are?\" Nicolle Wallace asked.\\n\\n\"I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,\" said Swift.\\n\\nWatch the videos from Taylor Swift on The View below.\\n\\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1u8Qmx0', 'source': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'publish_date': '1414566000.0', 'url': 'www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/29/taylor-swift-calls-out-record-label-pop-album-1989/18140569/', 'canonical_link': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/29/taylor-swift-calls-out-record-label-pop-album-1989/18140569/', 'authors': [\"Ryan O'Connell\", 'Published P.M.

      "{'news_source': 'gossipcop', 'text': 'After three years of marriage, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are still wildly attracted to each other. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how even with two kids, their sex life is off the charts.\\n\\nKim Kardashian works hard to maintain her enviable curves through grueling workouts, and boy has it paid off since she’s looking better than ever. That isn’t lost on hubby Kanye West, 40, as he knows he’s got the world’s hottest MILF for a wife.”Kim and Kanye are reliving their first few months of their relationship and are having some of the best sex of their lives. Kanye thinks Kim looks hotter than ever before and he feels honored to be her husband. She is 36 now and they have two kids but he is more attracted to her than ever,” a Calabasas insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\\n\\n“They are more in love today than ever before and the proof is in the bedroom. Their chemistry is hot and the sex is as good, if not better, than the first time they slept together. Kim keeps getting hotter in Kanye’s eyes and he loves it when his gorgeous wife flaunts it to the world before coming home just for him,” our source adds.\\n\\nKim did just that on July 13, going out on the town nearly naked ! She hit up Shibuya sushi restaurant in Calabasas in a clear plastic vinyl “dress” that exposed her bare boobs. The only thing she was wearing underneath was a small pair of creme silk panties and over it she had on a light grey duster that had to have been taped down very strategically because it rested right at her nipple line.
